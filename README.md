# 🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m a backend engineer (with frontend & ML interest), currently based in Canada (formerly Bay Area).  
I have strong Python and ML-simulation experience — lately focused on GPU-accelerated sparse-matrix diffusion simulations.  
I enjoy building quick prototypes end-to-end in hackathons and exploring ML / AI / data-driven ideas.  
Long-term goal: go all-in on entrepreneurship / startup life when I move back to Bay Area.

## 🏆 Hackathon Wins

### 🥇 1. Verkada Hackathon — **1st Place**  
**Project:** Golden Eye  
- Built a monitoring system that detects when a specific object goes missing in multi-camera CCTV footage.  
- Finetuned EfficientDet on ~500 labeled frames extracted from HLS streams across 5 cameras.  
- Triggered real-time alerts during inference when the object disappeared.  
- Fully working prototype demo’d live — won first prize.  

### 🥇 2. NeuroLearn — TEDAI Multimodal Hackathon — **Grand Prize**  
**Project:** NeuroLearn  
- Designed an AI-powered learning platform using brain-wave data (via Neurosity headset + SDK) to gauge student focus/interest and dynamically highlight relevant lecture snippets. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- If a section lacked engagement, the platform used a voice model (via ElevenLabs) to narrate the content through a “role-model” persona to retain interest. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- Built a personalized “knowledge graph” over time and recommended new content based on user’s interest and learning history. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Delivered a working demo under tight hackathon time — landed the top prize. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

### 🥈 3. Junto — SF AI Hackathon (hosted by MongoDB + AI partners) — **2nd Prize**  
**Project:** Junto  
- Built a system that automatically generates and delivers audio debates on any given topic — simulating different viewpoints as if famous people are debating. (Submitted on Devpost) :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- Used MongoDB Atlas + vector search, plus LLM-based pipelines, voice synthesis for audio output.  
- Overcame latency and quality-of-response challenges to produce a clean, demo-ready prototype under hackathon constraints — earned second place. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

### 🥉 4. RunPod Hackathon — **3rd Prize**  
**Project:** (My submission)  
- Competed in RunPod hackathon and secured a top-3 finish (third prize).  
- Demo was accepted and judged among top entries — ended up winning third prize.
