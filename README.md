# 🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m a backend engineer (with ML skillset also), currently based Bay Area.  
I have strong Python and ML-simulation experience — lately focused on getting SOTA on bird bench for NL-SQL tasks.  
I enjoy building quick prototypes end-to-end in hackathons and exploring ML / AI / data-driven ideas.

## 🏆 Hackathon Wins

### 🥇 1. Verkada Hackathon — **1st Place**  
**Project:** Golden Eye  
- Built a monitoring system that detects when a specific object goes missing in multi-camera CCTV footage.  
- Finetuned EfficientDet on ~500 labeled frames extracted from HLS streams across 5 cameras.  
- Triggered real-time alerts during inference when the object disappeared.  
- Fully working prototype demo’d live — won first prize.  

### 🥇 2. NeuroLearn — TEDAI Multimodal Hackathon — **Grand Prize**  
**Project:** NeuroLearn  
- Designed an AI-powered learning platform using brain-wave data (via Neurosity headset + SDK) to gauge student focus/interest and dynamically highlight relevant lecture snippets  
- If a section lacked engagement, the platform used a voice model (via ElevenLabs) to narrate the content through a “role-model” persona to retain interest  
- Built a personalized “knowledge graph” over time and recommended new content based on user’s interest and learning history
- Delivered a working demo under tight hackathon time — landed the top prize

### 🥈 3. Junto — SF AI Hackathon (hosted by MongoDB + AI partners) — **2nd Prize**  
**Project:** Junto  
-  Junto is a debate application between 2 characters
-  It Indexes latest news articles(indexed embeddings generated by Bert 80M 32K model by availing TogetherAI serverless endpoints and indexed those embeddings in MongoDB Atlas)
-  It uses RAG(Retrieval Augemented generation) on latest news articles to retrieve speech for both characters. On any given user prompt(debate topic), for a debate character speaker it searches for relevant embeddings based on the debate topic and  other speaker's previous comments using Bert 80M 32K model(availed from TogetherAI serverless endpoints, retrieves from MongoDB Atlas) and sends the relevant document chunks along with previous speakers comments using semantic search to Anthropic Claude v2 LLM and generates current speaker's speech and streams its character's audio using Eleven Labs API. - The character voices are finetuned in Eleven Labs(provides text to speech as a service among others)  
- Used MongoDB Atlas + vector search, plus LLM-based pipelines, voice synthesis for audio output.  
- Overcame latency and quality-of-response challenges to produce a clean, demo-ready prototype under hackathon constraints — earned second place.

### 🥉 4. RunPod Hackathon — **3rd Prize**  
**Project:** (My submission)  
- Competed in RunPod hackathon and secured a top-3 finish (third prize).  
- We had structured 8x8 covariance matrices as input(each element represents covariances of 8 sensors) from Nurosity headset, and the model should output a class determining an action that brain thinks of. We had 400k+ records in the dataset
- Current language models like BERT are not capable of doing a better job for structured data, convolution models are great when we have spatial data as input.
- Used non-linear discriminative models(Random Forest classifier produced great results for this speicific case), saved model, built docker and hosted in runpod serverless
- Test accuracy: 81.2%
